Clam Chowder

Ingredients:

2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 medium onion, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1 cup heavy cream
2 cups chopped clams, drained (reserve juice)
2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
1 bay leaf
Salt and pepper to taste
Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and celery, and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables start to soften.

Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute, until fragrant.

Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the flour has been fully incorporated.

Gradually pour in the broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Add the clam juice, potatoes, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

Add the chopped clams and heavy cream, and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Let the chowder simmer for another 5-10 minutes, or until the clams are heated through.

Remove the bay leaf, and serve hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
