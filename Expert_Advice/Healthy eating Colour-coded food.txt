Healthy eating: Colour-coded food

Some foods let you know their nutritional benefits by standing out from similar varieties.

1. Red peppers
These contain more vitamin C and five times more carotene than green peppers.

2. Gold kiwi
Kiwi contain impressive amounts of vitamin C, but the golden variety contains higher levels of antioxidant polyphenol phytochemicals and around 50 per cent more vitamin C.

3. Pink and red grapefruit
Sweeter than regular grapefruit, these contain 34 per cent more betacarotene, which the body converts into vitamin A.

4. Red onions
These have higher levels of the heart-healthy phytochemicals quercetin and anthocyanin than white varieties – and shallots are even higher.

5. Black grapes
Swap green grapes for black – both are a good source of vitamin C, but black grapes contain higher levels of the antioxidants that help protect against heart disease.
