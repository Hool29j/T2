Tomato Soup
Ingredients:

2 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 cans (28 oz each) of whole peeled tomatoes, with their juice
2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp dried oregano
Salt and pepper, to taste
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)

Instructions:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add the canned tomatoes and their juice to the pot, breaking them up with a spoon or a potato masher. Add the vegetable or chicken broth, sugar, dried basil, and dried oregano. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Remove the pot from the heat and let cool slightly. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth. If using a regular blender, be sure to work in batches and leave the lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape.

Return the pureed soup to the pot and season with salt and pepper to taste. If using, stir in the heavy cream until fully combined.

Serve hot with your favorite bread or crackers.
