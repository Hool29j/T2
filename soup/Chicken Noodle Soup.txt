Chicken Noodle Soup

Ingredients:

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
8 cups chicken broth
1 medium onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, minced
3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced
3 celery ribs, sliced
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and black pepper, to taste
8 ounces egg noodles
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Instructions:

Place the chicken breasts in a large pot or Dutch oven and add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.

Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside to cool. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces.

Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, sliced carrots, sliced celery, bay leaves, and dried thyme to the pot with the chicken broth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.

Bring the soup back to a boil, then reduce the heat and let simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.

Add the egg noodles to the pot and let cook for 8-10 minutes, or until they are tender.

Once the noodles are cooked, stir in the shredded chicken and chopped fresh parsley. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

Serve hot and enjoy!
