French Onion Soup

Ingredients:

4-5 large onions, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
8 cups beef broth
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 bay leaf
4-6 slices of French bread, toasted
1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
Fresh thyme, for garnish (optional)

Instructions:

In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, melt the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions, sugar, salt, and black pepper, and cook for 45-50 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized and a deep golden brown.

Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

Pour in the beef broth and white wine, and add the bay leaf. Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

While the soup is simmering, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and toast the slices of French bread until they are golden brown.

Ladle the soup into individual oven-safe bowls, and place a slice of toasted French bread on top of each bowl.

Sprinkle the grated Gruyere cheese over the top of the bread and soup, and place the bowls on a baking sheet.

Bake the soup in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

Garnish the top of the soup with fresh thyme leaves, if desired, and serve immediately.
