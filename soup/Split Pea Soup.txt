Split Pea Soup

Ingredients:

1 lb. dried split peas
1 large onion, chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium carrots, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 tbsp olive oil
8 cups vegetable or chicken broth
1 bay leaf
1 tsp dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: cooked ham, diced

Instructions:

Rinse the split peas in a colander and remove any debris or stones.
In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, carrots, and celery and cook until the onions are translucent, about 5-7 minutes.
Add the split peas, broth, bay leaf, and thyme to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let it simmer for 45-60 minutes, or until the peas are tender and falling apart.
Remove the bay leaf and discard it. If using ham, add it to the soup now and stir to combine. Let the soup simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes.
Using an immersion blender, blend the soup until it reaches your desired consistency. If you don't have an immersion blender, carefully transfer the soup to a blender in batches and blend until smooth.
Taste the soup and add salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot.
