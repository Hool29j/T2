Healthy eating advice

1. Look at labels
Traffic light labelling on the front of packs provides an at-a-glance guide to just how healthy (or not) a food is – but don’t forget to check the nutrition panel on the back too, which will help you compare brands, as well as the ingredients list to check what a food really contains.
2. Add a squeeze of lemon
Acidic foods such as lemon will lower the glycaemic index (GI) of pasta and rice, which will slow the conversion of starch to sugar.
3. Garlic: crush it, don't cut it
The more you damage garlic (and onion) cell walls, the more anticlotting sulphur phytochemicals – which help reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke – you release, which is why crushing is better than cutting. Resting crushed garlic for 15 minutes before use will boost levels even further.
4. Out of sight, out of mind
Hide sweets and biscuits away (or better still don’t buy them). Studies show that if you keep the biscuit tin or 'naughty' treats where you can see them, you’re more likely to succumb.
5. Plan ahead
Healthy eating is much easier if you plan your days. Set aside time at the weekend to write a healthy recipe menu plan for the next seven days. This will help you become more organised, and the investment in managing your meals will pay dividends when your energy levels and good intentions may be flagging later in the week.
